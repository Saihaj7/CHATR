# CHATR
A responsive full-stack web application that allows users to communicate with each other in real-time without the need to refresh the page. It utilizes MongoDB to store user data and messages, Express.js for building the backend API, React.js for the frontend user interface, and Node.js for server-side logic.

Synchronicity of live messages and live contact requests are carried out using web sockets that enable live bi-directional communication between the client and server without having to poll,  while API requests load message/contact history in bulk efficiently.
